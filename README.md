This is my mostly 3d printed dual vertical spinner battlebot (beetleweight class 3Lbs 1.5kg)
___________________________________________________________________________________________
My dual spinner battlebot is called Peklostroj 1.0  
its version 1.0 because there might be some changes in the future maybe 
___________________________________________________________________________________________
it is 4 wheel drive and has two weapon motors one for front one back 
it drives like a tank so there is one esc per 2 drive motors

the front weapon is fully custom the back is a 50mm saw mill blade
all the 3d files are in this repository and electric schematic and bom
I recommend using tpu for the tires (for grip)
